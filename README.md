Employee Salary Analysis 
# Employee Salary Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee salaries based on various factors such as position, experience, department, and gender. The goal is to explore correlations, detect patterns, and visualize insights using Python and data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle with understanding salary distributions, disparities, and factors influencing compensation. This project aims to:
- Analyze salary distributions across different job positions and departments.
- Explore the impact of experience on salary.
- Identify potential salary inequalities.
- Provide data-driven insights for better decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for employees.
- **Age**: Age of the workking employee.
- **Salary**: Employee's annual salary.
- **Experience_Years**: Total years of experience.
- **Gender**: Gender of the employee (used for demographic insights).

## Features of the Analysis
The Python script performs the following tasks:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Reads the dataset and checks for missing values.
2. **Statistical Overview**: Generates descriptive statistics for salary analysis.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - **Histogram & KDE Plot**: Shows salary distribution.
   - **Box Plot**: Compares salaries across different positions.
   - **Bar Plot**: Shows total salary expenditure per department.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Analyzes salary vs. experience.
   - **Count Plot**: Displays the number of employees per job position.
   - **Pairplot**: Examines relationships between multiple numerical features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
